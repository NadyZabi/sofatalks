                <p>For the first time, the SofaTalks project took place at the height of the COVID19 pandemic, 
                    on April 11, 2020. Since then, we have met every week to discuss various socially significant and 
                    simply interesting topics.
                </p>
                <p> The idea of SofaTalks is not to convince the participants of the discussion to the contrary, but to 
                    hear a different point of view. Understand the connection between " I do this because I think so”.
                    It’s expand to the boundaries of understanding and acceptance of different people, culture, and traditions.
                </p>
                <p> SofaTalks can be a place for heated discussions on completely different topics. Participants have the 
                    right to express their opinions without fear of being judged by other participants. Despite the freedom of 
                    expression, we have created a couple of rules of behavior during the conversation. You can read the rules in 
                    the Code of Conduct tab.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Every week, by voting in the telegram channel, we select the upcoming topic for discussion. Meetings are held 
                    at zoom every Thursday at 20:00 (CET). You can also get the room ID and password in the telegram channel. 
                    Join the SofaTalks telegram channel to stay up to date.

                <p>The discussion language is English.
                </p>
                <p>
